TuringMachineDiagram

Time for some simple automata?

Draw a TM diagram with â‰¤ 8 states to decide D...
This is one of the task some students have been done in their midterm.

In order to get a challenging A+ in the Automata and Formal Languages in University of Taiwan National, you decide to practice some previous years exam and become a smaller-than-k-states-automata master. (Unlike the author of this CTF problem, who isn't very good at these problems.)

One day, you found some previous students' work.

The key is recognizable by the following NFA:

Here's some nc addresses that you might want to get hint from during this openbook exam:
nc chall.ctf.bamboofox.tw 7619
nc chall.ctf.bamboofox.tw 7719
Maybe you'll want to get the file from or input the finded key into these two addresses?
Furthermore, due to an unknown reason, the key (and every related files) maybe occasionally change over time, but the flag will be consistent.
